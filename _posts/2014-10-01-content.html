        <p>We live in a rapidly changing world. The effects of climate change—such as heat waves, rising sea levels and more severe storms—are already being felt across the United States. Our energy infrastructure is especially vulnerable to climate-related impacts, which can pose a serious threat to America’s national security, energy security, economic wellbeing, and quality of life.</p>

    "summary":"Hawaii and Puerto Rico share many similarities in their energy systems, including reliance on imported petroleum and other fuels. In both of the island regions, projected sea level rise and hurricane storm surge threaten ports and other essential coastal energy infrastructure with flooding, wave damage, and erosion, while hurricane winds pose a danger to structures and power lines. Higher temperatures reduce the efficiency of fuel-burning power plants, leading to less electricity supply unless offset elsewhere. Other U.S. islands in the Pacific and in the Caribbean are likely to have similar climate impacts and resilience solutions as Hawaii and Puerto Rico.",

    "summary":"Northern latitudes, including all of Alaska, are warming faster than temperate regions, and the permafrost underlying much of Alaska’s interior and northern coastlines is at risk of thawing. That could cause the ground to shift and soften, potentially damaging pipelines as well as roads and airstrips used to transport fuel to remote rural communities. Thawing permafrost and declining sea ice have already sped up coastal erosion and damaged infrastructure in some areas. Warmer temperatures are likely to shorten the season during which ice roads can be used to reach oil and gas operations, and increasing wildfires could threaten the state’s extensive energy assets.",

    "summary":"Hydropower is a major source of electricity in the Northwest, providing more than 70% of the region’s power. Warmer temperatures and less mountain snowpack will cause streams fed by melting snow to reach their peak flow earlier in spring, leading to less available hydropower during the hot summer months when demand is highest. Increased wildfire threat also has the potential to disrupt electricity transmission.",

More frequent and severe heat waves will drive up electricity demand as people try to stay cool, while at the same time hampering the ability of natural gas- and coal-fired power plants to meet that demand. Other concerns as the region becomes drier include decreasing hydropower resources and wildfires threatening transmission lines.",

High winds, coastal erosion, storm surge and hurricanes threaten oil and gas production, ports, pipelines, refineries and storage facilities. Higher temperatures and more frequent, severe, and longer-lasting heat waves are also expected to increase peak electricity demand while reducing the capacity of thermoelectric generation and transmission systems needed to meet that demand.",

Hotter temperatures can also reduce the capacity of power plants and electric grid transmission during periods of high demand.
