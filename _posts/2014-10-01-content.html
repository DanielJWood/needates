    "summary":"Hydropower is a major source of electricity in the Northwest, providing more than 70% of the region’s power. Warmer temperatures and less mountain snowpack will cause streams fed by melting snow to reach their peak flow earlier in spring, leading to less available hydropower during the hot summer months when demand is highest. Increased wildfire threat also has the potential to disrupt electricity transmission.",

    "summary":"Many energy systems in the Southwest are already designed for hot and arid conditions, but climate change is going to put additional pressure on the region. More frequent and severe heat waves will drive up electricity demand as people try to stay cool, while at the same time hampering the ability of natural gas- and coal-fired power plants to meet that demand. Other concerns as the region becomes drier include decreasing hydropower resources and wildfires threatening transmission lines.",

    "summary":"More than 90% of the Midwest’s electricity is generated by coal-fired and other thermoelectric power plants. High temperatures can reduce both the generation capacity of those plants and the transmission capacity of power lines, while simultaneously increasing electricity demand for cooling. Drought and flooding can further disrupt fuel transport over land and water, in addition to hurting biofuel production and refining capacity in the region.",

High winds, coastal erosion, storm surge and hurricanes threaten oil and gas production, ports, pipelines, refineries and storage facilities. Higher temperatures and more frequent, severe, and longer-lasting heat waves are also expected to increase peak electricity demand while reducing the capacity of thermoelectric generation and transmission systems needed to meet that demand.",

Hotter temperatures can also reduce the capacity of power plants and electric grid transmission during periods of high demand. Along the coast, sea level rise and storm surge can threaten ports, electric grid equipment and power plants, while flooding from heavy rains can endanger energy infrastructure further inland such as roads, railroads, refineries and power lines.",
